# a recipe ingredients catalog

### functionality
This single-page full-stack app displays recipes from a Postgres database in a jQuery UI.  Each recipe has a list of ingredients displayed as a list editable tokens along with an input for adding new tokens (bootstrap-tokenizer).  Both recipes and their associated ingredients may be read, created, updated, and deleted via the Python/Django server.  

### the project
This was something of a time drill.
The build start to finish took me a couple days (and change).

## build challenges
While most of the build was quite straightforward, there were a few detours elicited by the idiosyncracies of bootstrap-tokenizer, as well as by choices to put certain validation and logic in backend.
